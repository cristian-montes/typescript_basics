// this is best practice when declaring types in a object. You don't want to go and specifically call every single data type in an objec because of redudantcy. it is still valid tho. 
const product = {
    id: '123n',
    price: 12.99,
    tags:['great offer', 'hot-and-new'],
    details: {
        title: 'Red Carpet',
        description: 'A great carpet - almost brand-new!'
    }
}
